Yue Zhou is now a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronic Engineering, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://ee.sjtu.edu.cn), supervised by Professor [Xue Jiang](https://sp.sjtu.edu.cn/) and Professor Xingzhao Liu. 
He also works closely with [Xue Yang](https://yangxue0827.github.io/) and [Tianwen Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tianwen-Zhang-4), focusing on rotated object detection and SAR ship detection tasks.
Before that, he received his bachelor degree at the School of Information and Communication, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

His main works lie in rotated object detection and SAR ship detection. He led the initial release of [MMRotate](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate) <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/open-mmlab/mmrotate?style=social" />, and has been leading the development of it since 2022.
