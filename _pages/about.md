Wenwei Zhang is a final year Ph.D. student at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. He is a member of [NTU MMLab](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), affiliated with the NTU S-Lab, supervised by Professor [Chen Change (Cavan) Loy](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/).
He also works closely with [Jiangmiao Pang](https://oceanpang.github.io/) and [Kai Chen](http://chenkai.site/), focusing on object recognition and scene understanding tasks.
Before that, he received his bachelor degree at the [Computer Science School](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University.
You can find his CV [here](/files/resume.pdf).

Yue Zhou is now a Ph.D. student in Department of Electronic Engineering, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://ee.sjtu.edu.cn), supervised by Professor [Xue Jiang](https://sp.sjtu.edu.cn/) and Professor Xingzhao Liu. 
He also works closely with [Xue Yang](https://yangxue0827.github.io/) and [Tianwen Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tianwen-Zhang-4), focusing on rotated object detection and SAR ship detection tasks.
Before that, he received his bachelor degree at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

His main works lie in rotated object detection and SAR ship detection. He led the initial release of [MMRotate](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate) <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/open-mmlab/mmrotate?style=social" />src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/open-mmlab/mmrotate?style=social" />, and has been leading the development of MMRotate since 2022.
