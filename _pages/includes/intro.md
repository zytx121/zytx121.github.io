Yue Zhou is now working as a Research Fellow at [S-Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/s-lab), Nanyang Technological University (南洋理工大学), focusing on Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models and UAV-based Agents. He works closely with [Mengcheng Lan (兰孟城)](https://mc-lan.github.io/), focusing on referring expression segmentation based on Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Previously, he received his PhD degree at the Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学), supervised by Professor [Xue Jiang (姜雪)](https://sp.sjtu.edu.cn/). 
He also works closely with [Xue Yang (杨学)](https://yangxue0827.github.io/), focusing on rotated object detection and SAR ship detection tasks. Before that, he received his bachelor degree at the School of Information and Communication, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (北京邮电大学). 

His main works lie in remote sensing vision language models, UAV-based agent and rotated object detection. He led the initial release of [MMRotate](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate) <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/open-mmlab/mmrotate?style=social" />, and has been leading the development of it since 2022.
