Yue Zhou is now working as a Research Fellow at [S-Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/s-lab), Nanyang Technological University, focusing on Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs). He works closely with [Mengcheng Lan (兰孟城)](https://mc-lan.github.io/), focusing on referring expression segmentation based on Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Previously, he received his PhD degree at the Department of Electronic Engineering, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://ee.sjtu.edu.cn), supervised by Professor [Xue Jiang (姜雪)](https://sp.sjtu.edu.cn/) and Professor Xingzhao Liu (刘兴钊). 
He also works closely with [Xue Yang (杨学)](https://yangxue0827.github.io/), focusing on rotated object detection and SAR ship detection tasks. Before that, he received his bachelor degree at the School of Information and Communication, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. His main works lie in rotated object detection and SAR ship detection. He led the initial release of [MMRotate](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate) <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/open-mmlab/mmrotate?style=social" />, and has been leading the development of it since 2022.


My research interest includes remote sensing vision language models, UAV-based agent and rotated object detection. I have published 30+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v-aQ8GsAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fzytx121%2Fzytx121.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI journals and conferences such as TGRS, ACM'MM, ICLR, CVPR.
